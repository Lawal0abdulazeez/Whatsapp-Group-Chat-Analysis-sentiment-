22/02/2024, 14:52 - +234 815 175 3236: Should I challenge this question

Or should I say that the question wasn't structured correctly

Abi my head no correct
22/02/2024, 14:53 - +234 809 073 9185: Maybe ooo
Just maybe
22/02/2024, 14:54 - +234 816 636 5481: you can
22/02/2024, 14:54 - +234 815 175 3236: Which of the options is the maybe aligned to 🌚🌚
22/02/2024, 14:57 - +234 815 175 3236: Numpy is a package for numerical computation

It is used for mostly vector metrics, which Python natively does not support 


So saying data analysis and manipulation, gives it a broad use case 

In the context of data analysis and manipulation, pandas is always referred to
22/02/2024, 14:59 - +234 816 636 5481: @2349034750619
22/02/2024, 15:01 - Bn Bazz 👳‍♀️: actually pandas should be the correct answer
22/02/2024, 15:02 - +234 816 636 5481: hmmm
22/02/2024, 15:03 - +234 810 352 1577: Pandas is not in the option 

The option closer to it is Numpy
22/02/2024, 15:06 - +234 815 175 3236: Okay
22/02/2024, 15:08 - +234 816 636 5481: For your mind, you dey challenge your elder 🤪
22/02/2024, 15:11 - +234 815 175 3236: Make I rest shaa😎😎

No challenge here, Not today 

But in an interview, I will challenge the question 

Either the question isn't structured correctly or the person asking didn't fill out the correct option

23/02/2024, 08:54 - +234 816 636 5481: HAPPY WEEKEND GREAT MINDS
23/02/2024, 09:05 - +234 816 812 9851: I'm sure it's an oversight,it should be a DQL maybe it wasn't found in the options that's why
23/02/2024, 09:05 - +234 816 812 9851: DQL are power query statements for data retrieval in a database👌
23/02/2024, 09:13 - Iremide: Language used to Query database is DQL
23/02/2024, 09:14 - Iremide: @2348168129851 

Is this keypad error
23/02/2024, 09:21 - Iremide: Hello Everyone

I have a little task for those skilled in python

Post the answer on the group, Its for one of us

Lets help and support each other
23/02/2024, 09:22 - Iremide: Q1. Develop a Python script that stores information about your favorite movies in a
dictionary. Each movie should have attributes such as title, director, year, and genre.
Allow the user to add new movies to the dictionary and retrieve information about
existing movies by searching with the movie title.
23/02/2024, 09:22 - Iremide: Q2, Design a Python program that includes a function to calculate the area of a
rectangle. The function should take the length and width of the rectangle as
input parameters and return the area. Prompt the user to input the dimensions
of a rectangle and use the function to calculate and print its area.
23/02/2024, 09:26 - +234 816 178 9740: Alright
23/02/2024, 09:27 - +234 816 812 9851: Yeah i meant a powerful Query statement
23/02/2024, 09:28 - +234 816 812 9851: Power query is ascribed  to Excel and Power Bi 😎
23/02/2024, 09:29 - Iremide: I get what you are trying to say

DDL, DQL,TCL are all embedded in SQL
23/02/2024, 09:30 - +234 816 812 9851: Exactly

29/02/2024, 18:53 - +234 806 409 7682: I am contending this answer. While option *c* is correct, option *d* is a stronger answer. While *group by* statement is used to summarize row, *distinct* can also do the same, but you cannot use the aggregate functions without using *Group by*. I stand to be corrected with a stronger response. Let's shake the table a bit.
29/02/2024, 18:57 - +234 703 035 0803: I think you can use aggregate function without using group by. It's depends on what you're looking for. <This message was edited>
29/02/2024, 19:35 - +234 906 467 8016: Good day. Please can I still pay for this class?
29/02/2024, 19:38 - +234 807 262 9050: You have a fair point but "Group By" itself doesn't compute the aggregation, it only groups the aggregation after the aggregation function has been passed into the rows.

My perspective is since It doesn't perform the calculation in isolation, option D may not be it
29/02/2024, 19:41 - +234 816 636 5481: I will get back to you soon
29/02/2024, 20:01 - +234 816 636 5481: Hey Fam, Today is the last day of the Month right?

How do we know you really smiled? 😜
04/03/2024, 20:33 - +234 810 496 1435: The answer is YES, but personally I will still say data is still in the embryo, it's yet to be born, the power of data is not yet really known, compared to what it will be in the future.

Now my reason for saying YES, data is absolutely used everywhere, data is just like money to me, tell me where they don't use money and I will tell you where data is not used.

Even when Industries are making new equipments, machines, they still need data to evaluate what they have done, basically data is used everywhere now!!!! <This message was edited>

Just to chip in a little. If we're considering the Nigerian context, you might be discouraged looking at how many of these companies still use an Excel workbook for data storage but I can guarantee it won't remain that way for long. One of the biggest airlines in the industry just adopted cloud data storage a year ago, another counterpart followed suit after seeing the value the first is getting. Both over the years have been using Spreadsheets for data management. 

Like @2348104961435, data democratization is still at an early stage in Nigeria because the awareness and literacy is just beginning to escalate. Give it 3-5 years from now and you'd have a full blown upsurge.

In all of this,the best you can do as an individual is to keep improving, developing capacity and growing, one thing I'm very certain of is the opportunities out there are enormous and getting them is dependent on us. <This message was edited>

04/03/2024, 21:45 - +234 706 098 0776: I think it depends on what angle you look at it from. When you talk to small business about data, they are almost lost in the terminologies. We mostly associate data to big and established organisations,but in truth the data small businesses generate on a daily basis is something to consider. And these said small businesses can't adopt cloud storage technologies, so how do you make data collection enticing to them...spreadsheets. Simple and straightforward.

After a stipulated time of data collection and insightful explorations, it begins to make sense to them. As they begin to scale and expand they adopt better cloud storage options. 

It's all about perspective and the dataset you are working on.
04/03/2024, 21:48 - +234 816 636 5481: Boss 🌚
04/03/2024, 21:48 - +234 806 409 7682: Experience, they say is the best teacher. Have you found yourself using a spreadsheet over and over again to store data, run analysis to the extent the spreadsheet document gets so heavy and difficult to open, or even crashed? Or have you found yourself using excel macros to the extent that the document gets heavy and crashed? Or have you found yourself creating many subsheets in a spreadsheet that you exhausted the limit, or even exhausted the number of rows and columns in your excel sheet? This limit point is what makes a data analyst to think of alternative solutions where you need a tool that can handle heavy data, point into a database straight and extract data, manipulate or clean it and get your results visualized. Experience in data analytics when you start with spreadsheets will definitely make you hungry for higher tools like SQL, Python, BI tools etc to do your job.
04/03/2024, 22:58 - +234 905 851 7499: Is Data the new oil? Yes it is. Are data analysts drowning in a sea of spreadsheet? For the most part yeah!

This comes down to a structural issue. How many organizations have a good data structure/culture? 

The truth remains even when you adopt cloud options, there’s no organization that can bypass spreadsheets. 

As much as data is the new oil, you also need the right equipments to drill the oil. Now the tech needed depends on the organization in question. Spreadsheet might be the best option for a lot of organizations (let’s not also forget you can store your spreadsheets in the cloud!). There’s a lot of considerations for the question asked, I think it’ll be a nice meet deliberation 😁

21/03/2024, 20:29 - +234 706 098 0776: I remember trying to handle datasets like my senior colleagues. Fast and accurate! But I later realised that being a data analyst needs soft skills as much as the technical skills. Patience and consistency and power to not give up. 

Sometimes your codes won't run,even after years of practice 😅, but we learn everyday and never stop...

For instance I want if I add up the count of categories in the adults it should add up to 100% instead of 19.26. Same applies to other row <This message was edited>
23/03/2024, 10:30 - +234 810 496 1435: Right-click on the adults, then u will see subtotal adults or something, then click it

23/03/2024, 13:23 - +234 806 409 7682: You are trying to run a proportionality function over one already. In mathematics principle  it's not ideal, but you can still work it out. That is. Divide each item value over the total item category and multiply by 100. E.g: for Adult category, divide Technology value (1.9 by 19.26) * 100. Do the same to other items values. Also apply the same logic to other categories.
23/03/2024, 13:31 - +234 806 409 7682: I can also see that the screenshot is pivoted output. If you don't want to use the method I shared earlier, which is meant to be computed on your data set, rather you want to run the computation on your pivoted output. The process is rigorous but you will achieve the same result as  above.
23/03/2024, 13:35 - +234 703 035 0803: I will try it when light comes
23/03/2024, 13:37 - +234 703 035 0803: I used "fields, items and set" to run the calculations but it brought out an error message
23/03/2024, 13:38 - +234 703 035 0803: I noticed that when I highlight for example all the value in the adults category it's summed up to 100%.
23/03/2024, 14:04 - +234 806 409 7682: Yes, you are only seeing it in the summary pane. You need to work it out on your sheet.
23/03/2024, 14:05 - +234 806 409 7682: You can share your data set with me let's work it together.

26/03/2024, 20:08 - Iremide: Learn a data tool at a time

Don't try to learn Excel, Power BI, and SQL all at once

Pace yourself. Learn Excel First, build projects.  Ensure your hands are strong with Excel in a way that when they wake u up to any task in Excel, you would deliver excellently.


Don't try to copy other people learning journey. Learn at your pace.

Network with people. Talk boldly about what you know in Data analytics. Share your knowledge. Opportunities will flock around you always.


People are watching and taking note. It might look like you have done all and nothing seem to happen. Just hang in there. One day, you would reap a  bountiful harvest of every knowledge you have sowed. You will get that dream job and look back and be amazed
26/03/2024, 20:11 - +234 816 636 5481: Wow, Amazing

Thank you  ma🙏
26/03/2024, 20:17 - +234 815 175 3236: People are watching and taking note is the key highlight for me 


This is what i always preach 

Forget about social media likes and comments 


The number of people watching are greater than the number of likes and comments you can get
26/03/2024, 20:18 - +234 816 636 5481: Wise words from the Wisdom Man 🥱

26/03/2024, 20:22 - +234 905 851 7499: Data analysis/analytics is not all about the tool. It’s more about structural thinking, logic, business understanding and problem curation. If you don’t have these skills you’ve missed it.

As much as it’s good to know how to use the tools well, your focus shouldn’t be totally on those!
26/03/2024, 20:24 - +234 816 636 5481: The Boss himself 💪
26/03/2024, 20:26 - +234 905 851 7499: 🌚
26/03/2024, 20:26 - Iremide: Absolutely 💯 


How you solve problems with the tool is very important.

Imagine a farmer with cutlass but doesn't know how to use it to cultivate the land. 

The cutlass is useless!.

Even if it is one word of advice, the newbies will appreciate it very well <This message was edited>
26/03/2024, 20:46 - +234 807 262 9050: I never reach the Agba baller phase as I'm still doing "God abeg"😂🤲🏽 but my little experience in the last 12 months as a DA, I can say a lot has been said regards the technical skills needed on the job but two soft skills I think are very important include "Requirements gathering and Empathy"

Skipping the first one means you would miss the major pain point of your customer or end user which has the propensity to make all your work useless. Have the technical skills don't miss out on understanding the business question/problem you're trying to solve as a data analyst

Second is empathy, there are cases where your end users wouldn't even know how to articulate their expectations better but you as the professional has to help them reach that point where they can say 'Yes, this is our problem'. 

So while the technical skills are important, you can proactively improve yourself on those subtle soft skills even as a beginner with no job yet, they make a huge difference in your works long-term. <This message was edited>

26/03/2024, 23:24 - Oluwatomisin DAE: • Embarking on this journey is a personal thing. You have to be convinced about what you are doing, what you want to do and what you want to get from this.

• Take it one step at a time. Go for mastery and depth don't just be a superficial learner that cares about building dashboards alone.

• Focus on your own growth not the 'noise' you see or hear around especially on social media.

I was thinking of how to *_refresh my Excel knowledge and join community to progress,_* thanks God for DAElite group.

I enrolled for *_Excel academy with DAElites,_* consistent with my daily learning, submitted all my assignments, and I just submitted my project for the academy recently waiting for feedback.
Very soon I should be graduating from the academy with *_knowledge pack of excel_*.

_Looking forward to the next phase._

02/04/2024, 20:29 - +234 806 621 9514: Imagine you have a big box of colorful building blocks. Data analysis is like sorting through those blocks to find out which ones are the same color, which ones are the tallest, or which ones are the heaviest. It helps us understand things better by organizing and looking closely at information.....



In a simple language, Data analysis is like sorting and organizing toys to understand them better.

02/04/2024, 21:38 - +234 815 175 3236: That decision is urs to make 

Ask yourself

which one excites me the most 

When I read the news and watch others project on it, which one re mine naturally drawn to

Which can i go on learning and researching for hours without losing my excitement and curiosity

Both are two broad career paths that takes time to master 

Which will it be for u, without feeling tired or frustrated

Cuz you may encounter it during ur learning period

The needed rain felled this afternoon. 

The city is cool 😎
21/04/2024, 18:59 - +234 816 636 5481: I didn't have any savings in my 20s, which made it difficult even to rent an apartment then. However, instead of worrying about my financial situation, I decided to invest aggressively in myself. I invested more than 60% of my income in buying books and attending workshops. I also took up programming, reading, writing, photography, and started traveling. Even though I couldn't afford to travel internationally, I traveled from state to state in Nigeria and visited over 30 states.

Now that I'm in my 30s, I'm grateful to my younger self for investing in my personal growth. I believe this advice might not apply to everyone, but if you find yourself in a situation where you don't have enough to keep up with your peers, it's important to focus on improving yourself. In the long run, the return on investment is exponential.

Since I do not have the funds to see the world like I have dreamt of, I was too intentional about investing in what I love to do and to the Glory of God, I have been a force to reckon with anywhere I appear.

23/04/2024, 10:41 - +234 706 459 7748: Oyo town in Oyo state 
Ibadan is capital city.
23/04/2024, 10:41 - +234 816 636 5481: Which one is Village and the Capital
23/04/2024, 10:41 - +234 706 459 7748: Aaah, let Oyo people catch you ooo
23/04/2024, 10:41 - +234 701 435 8596: Lol

There’s a place called Lagos island in Lagos
23/04/2024, 10:41 - +234 816 636 5481: Oyo Town in Oyo state 🥲

Omoo
23/04/2024, 10:41 - +234 809 073 9185: Ok now I’m confused 
So I’d take a bus from Ibadan going to oyo?
23/04/2024, 10:41 - +234 816 636 5481: This one I know but you see that Oyo town in Oyo Town

I am not understanding it at all 😭 <This message was edited>
23/04/2024, 10:42 - +234 701 435 8596: There’s a place called oyo town in oyo <This message was edited>
23/04/2024, 10:43 - +234 808 200 0929: Oyo state
23/04/2024, 10:43 - +234 701 435 8596: State
23/04/2024, 10:44 - +234 809 073 9185: Lagos island not Lagos town
23/04/2024, 10:44 - +234 816 636 5481: Hia

23/04/2024, 10:45 - +234 809 073 9185: These people just be confusing person 
Ondo town is different from ilorin 
Oyo town is different from Ibadan 
Abeg oooo
23/04/2024, 10:45 - +234 701 435 8596: No one called lagos a town
23/04/2024, 10:47 - +234 808 687 2530: Oyo is a state, ibadan is a capital

All focus is on ibadan.. 

If the settings is good, ibadan suppose to be a State on her own.
23/04/2024, 10:47 - +234 816 636 5481: This is a better explanation
23/04/2024, 10:48 - +234 816 636 5481: But you see that Oyo Town in Oyo state

I need further clarification 🥱
23/04/2024, 10:48 - +234 701 435 8596: Lol

There’s a town in oyo state called oyo town
23/04/2024, 10:48 - +234 816 636 5481: Even me too
23/04/2024, 10:48 - +234 813 293 1816: That doesn't change the fact that there's a part of OYO state called OYO town, which is different from Ibadan metropolis.
23/04/2024, 10:49 - +234 809 291 6988: No be wetin i talk be this…
23/04/2024, 10:50 - +234 808 687 2530: Yes, under oyo we have plenty towns which Oyo town is part
23/04/2024, 10:56 - +234 816 636 5481: ✅
23/04/2024, 10:58 - +234 703 035 0803: Why you no mention Calabar? 😀
23/04/2024, 10:58 - +234 816 636 5481: Uyo and Calabar are sisters 😉
23/04/2024, 10:59 - +234 703 035 0803: No.
23/04/2024, 11:00 - +234 816 636 5481: What is the difference 🤔
23/04/2024, 11:01 - +234 703 035 0803: No much difference
23/04/2024, 11:02 - +234 703 035 0803: Cross River - Calabar
Akwa Ibom - Uyo
23/04/2024, 11:03 - +234 703 035 0803: Lagos and Ogun are not the same 😀
23/04/2024, 11:05 - Iremide: Today is for State and Capital

23/04/2024, 11:09 - +234 806 268 0016: Lagos is a state just like Oyo state
Ikeja is the capital of Lagos state just as Ibadan is the capital of Oyo state
Lagos island is a place in lagos state that is different from Ikeja just as Oyo town is a place in Oyo state that is different from Ibadan

23/04/2024, 11:17 - +234 703 035 0803: That should be people from Abia, Enugu and Imo
23/04/2024, 11:17 - +234 703 035 0803: You need to pay me tuition fee
23/04/2024, 11:18 - +234 816 636 5481: That was years back

23/04/2024, 20:51 - +234 816 636 5481: I am waiting
23/04/2024, 20:59 - +234 806 228 1123: Yes, if there was no proper presentation of the report and no because they have no final say on the implementation of the report
23/04/2024, 21:02 - +234 816 636 5481: what about Maybe? 😂

Thanks for your response Boss
23/04/2024, 21:11 - +234 806 228 1123: Lol... Maybe, if the analysis wasn't properly done and a wrong conclusion was drawn
23/04/2024, 21:16 - +234 806 228 1123: Data analysts are the gate keepers of an organisation because every decision-making depends on the analysis (report) given.
23/04/2024, 21:17 - +234 816 636 5481: you added extra points

Reason I talk about you boss
23/04/2024, 21:19 - +234 806 228 1123: I still dey learn o 🙏🏼
23/04/2024, 21:21 - +234 816 636 5481: 🌚🥱
23/04/2024, 21:40 - +234 703 392 6636: *If its an analyst in healthcare, that can cost the life of a patient.*

But I'm sure there are carders of authority before a data driven decision is made. 

So long as the data wasn't panel beated, the blame shouldn't go only to the analyst, but also those he reports to

24/04/2024, 09:32 - +234 812 836 4069: Yes, and in this context, a data analyst is likened to a cook that prepares different types of dishes but fails to add a sufficient amount of salt or ingredient to the food. Trust me the people would question the efficiency of such a cook 😜. So bringing that back to a data analyst job, you have to be able to clean, manipulate, model and give a detailed visualization and if by chance, their predictions did not help in the area of expertise, they will face the consequence. <This message was edited>

24/04/2024, 09:44 - +234 816 636 5481: Data analysts face the consequences right?

what about stakeholders they report to? should they be involved too
24/04/2024, 10:02 - +234 916 194 8817: Yes,
Data Analyst should be held responsible and accountable  because at some point the information collected from the respondents might be false which will jeopardize the decision policy making,  for example information gotten from the field work might not be correct as a result of laziness
24/04/2024, 10:08 - +234 703 301 9754: Thank you for all the good job well done,you are love and God bless and multiply you .
24/04/2024, 10:14 - +234 703 301 9754: To some extent I think data analyst should be held responsible ,because they are to analyze information and detect wrong data's before sending them out ,thank you.

We appreciate you for all you do.
24/04/2024, 11:17 - +234 805 537 3292: Let's say you have two birthdays this year then 😄
24/04/2024, 11:21 - +234 805 537 3292: the simple answer is yes
24/04/2024, 11:26 - +234 816 636 5481: why?
24/04/2024, 11:27 - +234 805 537 3292: As data analyst, you have the power to shape decisions n this decisions can impact lives and livelihoods!
24/04/2024, 11:32 - +234 805 537 3292: There is a sticker I have that says " *prune the data and it will say anything!* " It tells of the tendency of a data analyst to be biase!
24/04/2024, 11:43 - +234 805 537 3292: So just as building engineers can cut conners and have poorly built building that can collapse, leading to devastating consequences, so too can a poorly conducted analysis with the above kind of mindset lead to decisions that can cause harm.
24/04/2024, 12:05 - +234 810 086 7815: Weldon Sis👍🏻 keep the good work going

1. Many persons engaged in the EXCEL poll but the number reduced in the Python Polls. This shows a need to upskill. Our python Academy will be open soon. Make plans to register, get your cash ready and save towards it.

2. There is a need for more engagement with the poll, this is part of the reason answer time was extended

25/04/2024, 22:51 - +234 816 165 0498: 🤔 why tuples appear in the answer? 
Enumerate() is a method that returns an iterator with index and element pairs from the original iterable

25/04/2024, 23:01 - +234 816 165 0498: For example 
 My_list = [ ‘Iremide’, ‘Chika’, ‘Mary’]
Result = enumerate(My_list)
#Output
[(0, ‘Iremide’), (1, ‘Chika’), (2, ‘Mary’)]

You can get the Microsoft Learn blogs for the topics covered in the questions.
02/05/2024, 13:11 - +234 802 466 5627: I agree with this
02/05/2024, 14:16 - Iremide: We have identified the problem

That is a skill gap

We should be thinking of how to close the skill gap. 

If, as a data analyst, you get interviewed for a job and you are asked questions on Azure

You won't say they didn't teach or a lot of analyst do not know Azure.


It's very vital to have a fair knowledge of AZURE, SAP, Cloud Services, etc

Do not limit yourself. Excel, PowerBI, SQL, and Python are to get you started.

From there, you have to keep building competencies.
02/05/2024, 14:17 - +234 703 630 1518: I agree with you 💯
02/05/2024, 14:18 - Iremide: Can we as a community train ourselves in Azure or Microsoft Fabric or SAP?


IF YES, 

Can we pay a token of 50k for the course

If NO

——————

When you're young (early grad), do all you can to build your skills

• Get experience
• Get the knowledge
• Focus on learning
• Work with people who demand excellence
• Build your soft skills e.g effective communication (One of the most important skills to own)
• Build your Attention to details

Improving your skills as an experienced career professional is more difficult due to the increasing demand of your time from varying responsibilities

Looking at the data from overseeing our programs at ProductDive adults drop off programs for circumstances above their control.
Sadly, If you don't upskill or learn, how would you drive results in your career or the company you work for?

If you say you're an experienced professional, results will be demanded of you. And if you're not able to achieve results, there are consequences.

Dear young career professional, don't be distracted. Avoid, the shining personal branding syndrome when you've got no depth or very little to offer. 

Build depth first.

And watch your career accelerate because you’ve got the right substance!

07/05/2024, 19:07 - +234 703 800 8599: I have tried it many times. I don't think it's possible. You either convert it to an Excel file and save all in a workbook or save each separately as a csv file, import each separately into power query then append

17/05/2024, 17:03 - +234 809 301 0623: AI can be really helpful for data analysts as it can provide all the means through which they can analyze the vast data quickly and efficiently. 

Moreover, AI is an excellent tool for spotting patterns and providing valuable insight from otherwise raw data. 

Data analysts can now concentrate on critical tasks rather than conducting monotonous labor all day long thanks to AI-driven automation.

there are many AI tools available for data analysts to use for their benefit. Below are a few for your reference:

1. Tableau
2. Polymer
3. Microsoft Power BI

Bible confirmed knowledge shall increase which is what we are seeing now. Importantly is for us to be positioned for opportunities.

This is an amazing group to gather the knowledge needed to navigate this information age we are.

17/05/2024, 17:14 - +234 812 210 9216: It will only abstract a huge layer of the task needed in generating insight
17/05/2024, 17:41 - +234 703 035 0803: Even if AI replaces jobs, not all companies will like to put their data for AI to analyze. No artificial intelligence can beat that of humans.
17/05/2024, 17:42 - +234 816 636 5481: Lol, what is this nh 🤣😂
17/05/2024, 18:19 - +234 806 228 1123: Well, nothing remains the same forever.
That's why it is essential to evolve with time, don't be stereotyped. Besides, AI will not completely replace us because not all organisations will be able to afford it. This replacement might not even happen in 10-15 years. So enjoy it while it lasts 😀😀😀 Peace ✌️

17/05/2024, 22:44 - +234 806 409 7682: AI cannot replace Data Analyst job 💯. AI works on the trends and pattern it is programmed to operate. Every organization has business ethics and culture on which base their business trends and insights. It's only a locally deployed AI that works in such situations. Why not make yourself an AI guru to have the ability to deploy a local AI to your organization and as well make yourself relevant in the taste of time. Revolve as the world revolves. You cannot remain in the tentacle of analysing data with a spreadsheets. Go beyond that level my dear.
17/05/2024, 22:49 - +234 816 178 9740: I'm currently developing an inventory system in Excel, and I have been using AI as my co-developer. 
17/05/2024, 22:52 - +234 903 421 7698: Beyond just uploading a spreadsheet and having AI perform the analysis for you, human experience is required to decide whether to accept the results or not.

For example, when working with location/traffic data, AI cannot really predict how long a car that broke down in traffic will remain there.
17/05/2024, 23:10 - +234 816 178 9740: Let's get things straight. As previously said, artificial intelligence is a buzzword. 

With the emergence of many AI tools available, it is critical for an individual to keep current. 

More crucially, aside from learning prompts in engineering, it is anticipated that one understands how a specific AI algorithm works in the event that it fails. If I recall well, I have recently had an encounter with these tools. I figured it out based on two factors: 

1. I understand how prompt engineering works (I compare the response to it). 

2. I have a better knowledge of natural networks and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. 

With them, I was able to readily identify the irregularities, so I immediately switched to doing it myself.

The only thing I’d say is AI will only replace people that don’t know how to use them. Learn the tools and add it to what you know.

18/05/2024, 11:51 - +234 703 035 0803: Hello house

18/05/2024, 11:53 - +234 809 073 9185: The sound dey sound like breeze from fan? <This message was edited>
18/05/2024, 11:54 - +234 703 035 0803: Yes
18/05/2024, 11:56 - +234 809 073 9185: Cooling fan
18/05/2024, 11:57 - +234 703 035 0803: Yes
18/05/2024, 11:57 - +234 703 035 0803: How can I fix it?
18/05/2024, 11:58 - +234 813 312 8209: The cooling fan is faulty or the processor thermal grease is dried up already
18/05/2024, 11:58 - +234 813 312 8209: I replied to you i don't know how manage the network stopped it

18/05/2024, 14:46 - +234 901 250 0896: What about laptop that cooling fan is working, but not displaying anything
18/05/2024, 14:47 - +234 809 073 9185: Screen, flex, backlight
18/05/2024, 14:49 - +234 901 250 0896: The sound of cooling fan get louder after some time. My mind tells me it's from the board
18/05/2024, 15:06 - +234 809 073 9185: Ok 
You can check an engineer
18/05/2024, 15:32 - +234 901 250 0896: Alright thanks
18/05/2024, 18:32 - +234 701 794 2276: I'm just seeing this!! 

I attended a seminar last year by a renowned professor in the US on the effect of AI on jobs and he mentioned the same thing.

Well AI can't take your job if you know how to use AI. So I think it's just a call  that analyst needs to learn how to use AI tools to automate their work.
This will reduce the workforce, YES! What do I mean? the number of data analysts in a company can reduce from 10 to 2 . So for you to be among the 2 you will have leverage on the use of AI.

I have a lot to say about this but typing will fail me🤦🤦. 

Let me say this again, if you are not a data analyst you can't use AI to analyze effectively, and also to do proper interpretation. So a data analyst will still be required to use AI. I think this makes more sense. Let me stop here. 

So there are now different AI tools incorporated into some of our analytical tools. Do well to have a developer acct and learn how to use them. 

Thank you 🙌🏼🙌🏼
18/05/2024, 18:37 - +234 701 794 2276: Yes. I attended the launching of Gemini pro. It has that feature. But if you don't know the basis of analysis you can't use it effectively and also get the right insight.  It makes work easier for analysts actually thereby reducing workforce for companies. Moreover not everyone can afford the subscription.
18/05/2024, 18:39 - +234 701 794 2276: I enjoyed reading everyone's input on this topic. 

So fear not newbies, master your skills well first then leverage on AI. You're good then 💪🏼💪🏼
18/05/2024, 18:51 - +234 816 636 5481: Thank you for sharing, I enjoyed reading it with many others input too <This message was edited>

18/05/2024, 18:56 - +234 808 684 3386: As a Data Analyst 
Which program do you recommend for someone to learn first before moving to other program
18/05/2024, 18:57 - +234 701 794 2276: For me, learn Excel properly
18/05/2024, 18:59 - +234 701 794 2276: Or let me say spreadsheet (Excel and advanced of it) you can learn Google sheet too. Because some companies use it more so that you can have the team working on different sheets in a workbook at the same time and for updates of real time
18/05/2024, 18:59 - +234 808 684 3386: After Excel 
Which program can someone learn 
I believe I'm already 70% done with Excel
18/05/2024, 18:59 - +234 808 684 3386: Wait
Google sheet and Excel 
Is there any difference
18/05/2024, 19:00 - +234 701 794 2276: Then you can consider learning a visualization too . (PowerBI, Tableau)
Then Sequel
18/05/2024, 19:01 - +234 808 684 3386: Alright 
Thanks
18/05/2024, 19:01 - +234 808 684 3386: Next project is visualization
18/05/2024, 19:02 - +234 701 794 2276: No major difference, they do the same thing but you might want to watch some videos and see how things are done on google sheet too. Some of the functions are located in different places than you have in excel
18/05/2024, 19:02 - +234 701 794 2276: These are just my opinion,  you can wait to listen to more views from other experts here.
18/05/2024, 19:03 - +234 816 636 5481: are you not an expert? 🌚 <This message was edited>
18/05/2024, 19:04 - +234 808 684 3386: I believe same thing applies on the Excel program you are familiar with 
Like the 2013 interface is totally different from the 2019 which I'm not really familiar with
18/05/2024, 19:05 - +234 808 684 3386: He said his view 
Expert might have different opinions
18/05/2024, 19:06 - +234 701 794 2276: 🤣🤣.. I didn't say that. I have bosses here too. I still learn from people daily too. So adding up so many inputs can help make good and better decisions. That's what I mean ma
18/05/2024, 19:08 - +234 701 794 2276: Hmmm, to some extent. If anyone is learning excel with 2019 you're wrong not to talk of 2013. That's my opinion . My students and everyone I mentor or talk to on data analytics knows that .
18/05/2024, 19:10 - +234 808 684 3386: I work on that level and upgrade to 2023
Thanks
18/05/2024, 19:13 - +234 701 794 2276: Let me tell you something funny that happened to me last month,
I had an interview session and the guy asked me if I have used groupby and pivotby functions in Excel. 

I first shock 🤣🤣, I said yes and I explained the function using sequel and R . But the guy said I was using idea. Believe me , I have not used it before but I saw the update when they added , since I joined the 365 developer community. 

So imagine the guy asking me functions that's not yet available to everyone🤣🤣. So you just need to be updated in this field <This message was edited>
18/05/2024, 19:13 - +234 701 794 2276: That's better.
18/05/2024, 19:15 - +234 808 684 3386: Thanks for the info

For Exce,l developers have access to using Python with Excel which is so beautiful creating  charts than the normal ones in Excel. Just to mention a few
19/05/2024, 20:23 - +234 813 775 5598: Don’t mention please talk we are all here to learn
19/05/2024, 20:25 - +234 701 794 2276: With the copilot you can just type the kind of calculations you want in normal word and it can write the DAX(measure) for you .
I have not really explored much of it because I can't access my acct anymore.

 *Who should own Data?*
Individuals, Corporations, or Governments

Back your answers with reasons
28/05/2024, 20:21 - +234 814 312 6357: government 

my reason why is that with government in charge, it can be made open for public use without any monopoly
28/05/2024, 20:22 - Iremide: Hmmmm
28/05/2024, 20:23 - Iremide: I feel the question is a bit ambiguous 


Which kind of data are we talking about exactly
28/05/2024, 20:24 - Iremide: As a business, you don't want the government to be in charge of your business data <This message was edited>
28/05/2024, 20:25 - +234 814 312 6357: well, there’s that too
28/05/2024, 20:31 - +234 813 069 0669: Government policies and decisions revolves around Data which affect everyone that is individuals and businesses. In terms of priority Government need to own data above others.
28/05/2024, 21:08 - +234 812 780 6082: Including classified data?
28/05/2024, 22:43 - +234 703 035 0803: Data is owned by an individual. The government might conduct a survey to get data on any project they want to embark on. 

For instance, if the government wants to provide a laptop to all teenagers who want to study computer science, the government can't provide such data because they don't have such information. They need to conduct a survey by going to schools, homes etc to get the data from teenagers.

With that can you say the government owns the data?
28/05/2024, 22:49 - +234 703 035 0803: The same applies to corporations, institutions, organizations etc.

04/06/2024, 21:05 - +234 704 848 1797: If u follow the right step 🪜 of learning the journey to becoming a data analyst would be made easier...
04/06/2024, 21:07 - +234 905 022 0346: Also, this depends on a lot of factors as well. I’m 5 months into data analytics and I got my first gig (in dollars) last month. I didn’t know anything in this field when I started in February. Plus I only knew excel and power bi and recently picked up Python. One thing I believed helped me was that I made a commitment to learn every day and I’m still learning. I’m always on a project and don’t finish one before I start the other so I maintain my chain of learning. I put myself out there as much as I can and I tell people about what I do. I am not ashamed to ask for help no matter how insignificant it might look. I don’t really care provided it gets me what I need. Big thanks to @2349034750619 and her team for always pushing and encouraging us. I owe a huge chunk of my growth to them and the DAElite community.

15/06/2024, 16:57 - +234 816 636 5481: Two set of people in this Community 

*1. Those that want to transition into Data Analytics*

Career Transition is hard and do you know what makes it harder? No mentorship, no structured learning, zero clarity about the new field.  If you want to start your Tech Journey in Data Analytics, this training is for you.
Are you transitioning from no-code Tech Field?

Are you confused, stagnant or inconsistent with your learning?

 Our Academy comes with practical courses, mentorship,  fun learning Environment etc. and lots more 

*Interested to kickstart your Data Analytics Academy, Join our Excel Training starting on 23rd June*

 It's time to score that goal in your plan this year. 

*2. Those that are overwhelmed from YouTube videos.* 

*The YouTube our Life Saver  Gang* 🥱,  I love this set of people more because the zeal of the Data World has consumed them. These set of people are determined, focused, set to achieve their goals yet they get burnt out constantly. They believe that YouTube is the answer to all their Data Questions, sighs 🥲.  The truth is that your career progression requires investment. YouTube can't give you everything you need. Anything you value, you put your money there. If you value your Career, invest in it. 

Most of you went to higher institution and paid hundreds of thousands to study a course with no job guarantee🫣. You will remain stagnant in  your Career if you refuse to invest in it. For those that  will play long term in this field, watching YouTube videos alone  will never be enough. I am not trying to undermine it. YouTube is a free University. Infact I love YouTube alot. 

There is more in this Data Career than YouTube Videos. You need a community of like-minded people, Mentorship, Hands on practice etc. 

You get this and more when you enrol for our Excel Academy . Even if you have to borrow, do it. There is a huge ROI (Return in Investment)in this field.  

It's time to shorten your learning curve with the right training. What will take you 6months to 1year. In less than 2-3 months, you have mastered the Basics.

 *Join our Excel Academy to excel in the world of Data Analytics.*

17/06/2024, 17:46 - +234 816 636 5481: The key to improving our performance in any area of life is
identifying the basics and being relentlessly committed to
performing them consistently.
And that's hard because the basics are usually boring.
They're mundane.
They’re monotonous.
We all want to chase what's flashy and sexy, but the gold is in the
basics.
The highest performers I've ever been around —in basketball or
business— have found a way to fall in love with the basics and
make them a part of their daily routine.

19/06/2024, 11:38 - +234 816 636 5481: okay, maybe next time
19/06/2024, 11:38 - +234 909 033 0531: I agree
19/06/2024, 11:38 - +234 703 035 0803: No patience here
19/06/2024, 11:39 - +234 909 033 0531: It might be a mistake 🤷‍♀️
19/06/2024, 11:39 - +234 816 636 5481: The rule is that Link should pass through Admin
19/06/2024, 11:39 - +234 703 035 0803: The longer you wait. The more people he gets
19/06/2024, 11:39 - +234 809 073 9185: This is like the second or third time I’m saying this 
He posted that by 11:29 I don’t know exactly what time he delete it but I know he did it himself and I’m sure it wasn’t up to 5mins 
I understand that rules are rules , at least I’m not one to break them but nobody is above mistakes
19/06/2024, 11:39 - +234 909 033 0531: At least the person deleted it almost immediately 🤷‍♀️
19/06/2024, 11:40 - +234 909 033 0531: And that shows regards fa
19/06/2024, 11:41 - +234 809 073 9185: Personally, I send links to various groups and I believe a lot of us here do too, one of us could be victim one day and then e go pain say dem just remove us like that 
If he didn’t delete it in time, then that’s different case. But anyways, rules are rules so it is what it is
19/06/2024, 11:41 - +234 703 035 0803: Almost 20 people read the post under that 5 minutes
19/06/2024, 11:42 - +234 816 636 5481: I can bet it was very intentional
19/06/2024, 11:42 - +234 809 073 9185: That’s cos we’re in an Active community 
I have a group where over 20 people would read in 5 mins and in same time frame, you’d have about 8-10 engagements
19/06/2024, 11:42 - +234 703 035 0803: Posting links to your dashboard or post on LinkedIn is different from what that guy did
19/06/2024, 11:42 - +234 816 636 5481: because Bright commentedd
19/06/2024, 11:43 - +234 703 035 0803: Yes.
19/06/2024, 12:06 - +234 808 737 4878: Probably we should resort to regulating the group

Opening and closing the group! But what joy will that bring?

Let's spill the tea on all things Data

On Today's Episode 👇👇👇

*Will computers and robots take over jobs that Data analysts currently do*? 

Elites, what are your thoughts? 😇
25/06/2024, 20:07 - +234 814 324 9955: No
25/06/2024, 20:07 - +234 814 324 9955: It can't
25/06/2024, 20:08 - +234 816 636 5481: why?
25/06/2024, 20:22 - +234 816 636 5481: @2348139264625 @2348055523612 @2348094536450 @2347017942276
25/06/2024, 20:27 - +234 813 721 8708: No matter how sophisticated AI models get, they will never be able to replace essential analytics skills like ethical judgment, strategic planning, emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and the ability to come up with complex inquiries.
25/06/2024, 21:13 - +234 816 636 5481: I agree with you too
25/06/2024, 22:07 - +234 817 045 5308: I don't think so though
25/06/2024, 22:08 - +234 816 636 5481: okay, what is your reason?
25/06/2024, 22:09 - +234 817 045 5308: Not all functions that an AI can perform
25/06/2024, 22:09 - +234 817 045 5308: Relating to been an analyst
25/06/2024, 22:15 - +234 817 045 5308: Planning and time management
25/06/2024, 22:15 - +234 803 371 5692: AI is unlikely to completely replace data analysts, but it will likely change the nature of the job. Here's why:

* **Focus on human skills:** AI excels at crunching numbers and identifying patterns, but it struggles with the communication, critical thinking, and business understanding that are crucial for data analysts. Analysts will focus on using AI tools to extract insights and translate those insights for non-technical audiences.

* **Evolving role:** Data analysts will likely spend less time on data cleaning and manipulation, which can be automated by AI. Instead, they will focus on higher-level tasks like asking the right questions, interpreting results, and recommending actions based on data.

So, AI will likely become a collaborator for data analysts, not a replacement. Analysts who can leverage AI tools and communicate insights effectively will be in high demand.

I will get to you shortly
01/07/2024, 08:51 - +234 816 636 5481: *As we have reach the midpoint of the year, it's a perfect time to reflect on our career journeys and plan for the months ahead.*  Here are some key points to consider during your mid-year career review:

1. Assess Your Goals
Review Your Progress: Look back at the goals you set at the beginning of the year. Have you met your milestones? What progress have you made towards achieving them?
Adjust Your Goals: If certain goals no longer align with your current aspirations, don't hesitate to adjust them. It's important that your goals remain relevant and motivating.

2. Celebrate Achievements
Acknowledge Your Wins: Celebrate both big and small victories. Whether it’s completing a major project, learning a new skill, or receiving positive feedback, every achievement counts.
 It’s important to highlight your contributions and value.

3. Identify Challenges
Analyze Setbacks: Reflect on any challenges or setbacks you faced. What obstacles hindered your progress? Understanding these can help you develop strategies to overcome them in the future.
Ask for feedback from colleagues, mentors, or supervisors. Constructive criticism can provide valuable insights into areas where you can improve.

4. Enhance Your Skills
Continuous Learning - Identify new skills or knowledge that could benefit your career. Enroll in courses, attend workshops, or participate in webinars to stay updated with industry trends.
Leverage Resources: Utilize resources such as online learning platforms, industry publications, and professional networks to enhance your skills and knowledge.

5. Evaluate Work-Life Balance
Reflect on Well-being: Assess your work-life balance. Are you managing your time effectively? Are you taking care of your physical and mental health?
Make Adjustments: If you’re feeling overwhelmed or burned out, consider making adjustments to your routine. Prioritize self-care and set boundaries to maintain a healthy balance.

6. Set New Goals
Short-term Objectives: Set new short-term goals for the second half of the year. These should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
Long-term Vision: Revisit your long-term career vision. Ensure that your short-term goals align with your overall career aspirations.

7. Network and Build Relationships
Expand Your Network: Strengthen your professional network by connecting with industry peers, attending networking events, and engaging on professional social media platforms like LinkedIn.
Mentorship: Consider finding a mentor or becoming one. Mentorship can provide valuable guidance, support, and opportunities for growth.

8. Reflect on Personal Growth
Self-awareness: Reflect on your personal growth. How have you developed as a professional? What have you learned about yourself and your work style?
Celebrate Growth: Acknowledge the personal growth you’ve achieved. Recognizing your development is just as important as professional achievements.


Moving Forward
The second half of the year offers a fresh opportunity to realign your focus, set new goals, and continue growing in your career. Use your reflections as a foundation to build on your successes, address your challenges, and achieve your aspirations.

Remember, career growth is a continuous journey. Stay motivated, remain adaptable, and keep striving for excellence. 

*Here’s to a successful second half of the year!*

02/07/2024, 20:25 - +234 703 035 0803: I don't really think statistic is a really a major criteria
02/07/2024, 20:25 - +234 816 636 5481: okay, why?
02/07/2024, 20:27 - +234 703 035 0803: Most hiring manager uses those discipline to filter out applicant
02/07/2024, 20:29 - +234 703 035 0803: Some job advert will use STEM - Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics
02/07/2024, 20:29 - +234 814 324 9955: That's not a barrier na, they can learn
02/07/2024, 20:31 - +234 703 035 0803: Is not easy to learn statistics when you're coming from humanity background
02/07/2024, 20:32 - +234 814 324 9955: True! But what am saying is the application of the soft skills in the carrier, not the requirements of the company. Not data analyst can rule out statistics, statistics is everywhere, we use it everyday. Statistics in decision making, in analysis, in quality control, in building dashboard.etc
02/07/2024, 20:33 - +234 816 636 5481: @96176913118 what do you think?
02/07/2024, 20:34 - +234 703 035 0803: Fola is sleeping
02/07/2024, 20:34 - +234 814 324 9955: Nothing is easy! Is not easy to learn data analysis either but with persistence people do it. Statistics is broad and there are simple statistics as well. Like this central of tendencies, mean, media, mode, bar chart, pie chart, histogram n co.
02/07/2024, 20:35 - +234 703 520 2319: Mathematics, statistics, computers and other courses is an added advantage for a Data Analyst.

But if you need to be a pro in them to be a Data Analyst?

For me; the answer is NO!

You only need basic knowledge in those fields.
02/07/2024, 20:37 - +234 703 035 0803: Do we really need maths, when Excel can do the calculations. Just know the functions
02/07/2024, 20:39 - +961 76 913 118: Mathematics is crucial for data analyst because in one way or the other you will use it ,for example your agrigatr functions and writing Dax , also your statistics (mean, max, min , median, mode ) you might not need advance math as a beginner,but know your basic calculations for specific kpI s
02/07/2024, 20:40 - +234 703 520 2319: But you have basic maths knowledge before you can use Excel.

You understand what sum, average, mean, subtract, add does in arithmetic, right?

That's why I said, you only need basic knowledge or understanding of mathematics and other courses to excel as a data analyst
02/07/2024, 20:47 - +234 913 206 4574: I thought is in data science we need more of statistics
02/07/2024, 20:52 - +234 706 383 3585: so why do they say anybody can learn data analytics
02/07/2024, 20:54 - +234 816 636 5481: how you take know?
02/07/2024, 20:55 - +234 816 636 5481: I support you
02/07/2024, 20:59 - +234 816 636 5481: hmmm
02/07/2024, 21:01 - +234 816 636 5481: well, everyone did the basics of mathematics right?

If you have the foundation of mathematics then you can learn Data Anaytics
02/07/2024, 21:02 - +234 816 636 5481: my own 2 cents
02/07/2024, 21:03 - +234 706 383 3585: Furthermaths too I remember I also did some statistics in 100 level
02/07/2024, 21:04 - +234 703 035 0803: To be a data analyst is not moi moi oo.

You must know little of maths, statistics, and computer science. With all this knowledge AI is threatening us.
02/07/2024, 21:04 - +234 706 383 3585: Hmmm

02/07/2024, 21:11 - +234 703 035 0803: Are you sure the mean the basic of mathematics? Because the way people put emphasis on mathematics is as if one must have a PhD in it.

For Data Analytics;
Look at Point 2,4,5,8,9-Python is optional 

For Data Science
Look at Point 1,6,7

The height of mathematics a data analyst needs to know is BODMAS and conditional statement using IF

03/07/2024, 11:53 - +234 809 453 6450: To me, I believe one need the knowledge of basic mathematics such as Bodmas, that prowess own na long thing. The way I see data analytics, it is more of how you can reason logically and do things out of the box.
03/07/2024, 11:57 - +234 703 035 0803: Hmmm. Basic knowledge of maths was taught in elementary School and secondary school.
03/07/2024, 11:57 - +234 703 035 0803: The emphasis on mathematics is beyond basic knowledge
03/07/2024, 12:01 - +234 808 200 0929: Are statistics, regression, and probability basic?
03/07/2024, 12:01 - +234 808 200 0929: Are Descriptive and predictive statistics
03/07/2024, 12:01 - +234 808 200 0929: ?

@⁨Vic Simeon⁩ has explained it properly too

If you are a Data Analyst and you are doing dy/dx or quadratic equations or hypothesis testing 

Raise your hand..
03/07/2024, 12:06 - +234 810 352 1577: When we say Basic ....we mean basic

BODMAS and conditional statement, Understanding logical reasoning and thinking out of the box

This is all you need

Let's not complicate things.....Data analytics is not that deep in mathematics or statistics <This message was edited>
03/07/2024, 12:07 - +234 703 035 0803: Is dx DAX?
03/07/2024, 12:07 - +234 810 352 1577: No
03/07/2024, 12:08 - +234 810 352 1577: DAX Is data analytics expression

It's a term used in Power BI, what it means in layman term is Formulas
03/07/2024, 12:09 - +234 703 035 0803: True. But the emphasis on it is too much
03/07/2024, 12:10 - +234 810 352 1577: I don't understand 😕
03/07/2024, 12:12 - +234 703 035 0803: What I mean is, the way people talk about mathematics and statistics in data analytics makes it look as if is a must have and the basic knowledge of it is not enough <This message was edited>
03/07/2024, 12:15 - +234 810 352 1577: Those people are not data analyst and most of them have never worked as a data analyst.

They just pick things online and blindly talk about it

They complicate things for people starting the career. 

All those statistics skills is needed in Data Science, I am sure the statistics they do is different from what your lecturer taught you in the university.
03/07/2024, 12:18 - +234 810 352 1577: Next time someone mentions statistics in data analytics, ask them to show you the statistics they do?

Lets explore the meaning of Statistics, I feel sometimes we need to know the meaning of a word to understand the context in which it is been used
03/07/2024, 12:20 - +234 810 352 1577: What is Statistics?

Definition 1: Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.

Definition 2: Statistics is the branch of mathematics for collecting, analysing and interpreting data. Statistics can be used to predict the future, determine the probability that a specific event will happen, or help answer questions about a survey.

Definition 3: Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that involves the collection, description, analysis, and inference of conclusions from quantitative data.
03/07/2024, 12:24 - +234 810 352 1577: What is Data Analytics ?

Data analytics is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision.

From the definition, you would agree that there is a lot of similarities between statistics and data analytics

My conclusion based on definition is that

Data Analytics is statistics used to draw conclusion and drive informed decision

Data Analytics > Statistics
03/07/2024, 12:25 - +234 705 466 6447: Statistics is the language of data analytics.
03/07/2024, 12:25 - +234 810 352 1577: Should we have a full lecture on Data Analytics and Statistics to help settle this once and for all
03/07/2024, 12:26 - +234 813 069 0669: Or an article to support our claims
03/07/2024, 12:29 - +234 703 035 0803: Please what's the meaning of dy and dx?
03/07/2024, 12:32 - +234 810 352 1577: its a formula in calculus, if you did Mathematics or Futher Maths or Applied math

Its represent the gradient a curve in a graph, where the derivative of y is in respect to x

Its a long jargon, that you dont have to worry yourself about <This message was edited>

Please I really need your help, if you can🥹

I'm meant to attach a single File that consist of 2 documents merged together(one is a document while the other is a PowerPoint presentation) of my findings .
I'd done the merge but the new folder is automatically saved on My WPS cloud.
I tried uploading it on the website but its unsupported.

1.Is there perhaps a way I can remove the folder from my WPS cloud and save it on my device?
2. Can I merge and create a folder for the 2 files, then attach?
3. Is there perhaps any other approach I can take, to merge the documents as one and upload successfully on the website?
PS : I can only attach one file on the website 

I've browsed online but I've not been able to solve this😩🥺

Kindly treat as a matter of urgency 🙏
05/07/2024, 11:32 - +961 76 913 118: There should be an instruction for file type   And size on the website you’re trying to upload to

05/07/2024, 12:12 - Iremide: Here are three disadvantages of not knowing SQL:

1. Limited Data Management Skills: SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for managing and manipulating databases. Without SQL knowledge, individuals may struggle to efficiently query, update, or analyze data stored in relational databases. This can lead to inefficiencies and missed opportunities in data-driven decision-making processes.

2. Reduced Job Opportunities: Many job roles, especially in data analysis, data science, software development, and database administration, require SQL proficiency. Not knowing SQL can limit career opportunities and make it challenging to qualify for positions that involve working with databases.

3. Dependency on Others: Without SQL skills, individuals may rely heavily on colleagues or IT departments to retrieve or manipulate data, leading to delays and potential miscommunication. This dependency can hinder productivity and reduce the ability to independently explore and analyze data for insights.

07/07/2024, 07:22 - +234 703 953 0180: A lovely work. Dashboard was aesthetically pleasing and the report was well written.

I do suggest that the work should've been in a passive form and past tense, since you were reporting what you did and not what you intended to do. For the passive form and past tense, I mean that every 'I will leverage the PMAFRD framework' should change to (something like) 'PMAFRD framework was leveraged on'.

You go teach me how to build models though: I need a bit of tutoring on that.

Well done on the jobdone bro.

12/07/2024, 06:44 - +234 907 815 9834: If it's total unit Sold for Lounge under department. Just remove duplicate of Dept on another column

Then use sum if (criteria range( that's your Original dept column), criteria ( the lounge in your remove duplicate), sum_range( your unit sold))

That should work if I get your question correctly
12/07/2024, 06:46 - +234 907 815 9834: Cell referencing is important too. Use Absolute cell reference. Lock the column when you select lounge so it will spill too another item

12/07/2024, 06:57 - +961 76 913 118: First use UNIQUE to list the items you have , then use SUMIF to get the item sold for each product

Good things come to those who deliberately, take action. 

Those who put in all of the work required to get to their desired goal. 

And most importantly, 

Good things always come to those who take advantage of opportunities that come their way.

16/07/2024, 19:36 - +234 816 812 9851: Here are the steps to install MySQL on MacBook ¹ ²:

1. Download the MySQL disk image (`.dmg`) file from the official MySQL website.
2. Double-click the file to mount the disk image and see its contents.
3. Double-click the MySQL installer package from the disk.
4. Click "Continue" to begin the installation.
5. The MySQL community edition shows a copy of the relevant GNU General Public License. Click "Continue" to proceed.
6. From the Installation Type page, you can either click "Install" to execute the installation wizard using all defaults or click "Customize" to alter which components to install.
7. Although the option is visible, the installation location cannot be changed.
8. Click "Install" to install MySQL Server.
9. The installation process ends here if you are upgrading a current MySQL Server installation. Otherwise, follow the wizard's additional configuration steps for your new MySQL Server installation.
10. After a successful new MySQL Server installation, complete the configuration steps by choosing the default encryption type for passwords, define the root password, and also enable (or disable) MySQL server at startup.
11. The default MySQL password mechanism is `caching_sha2_password` (Strong), and this step allows you to change it to `mysql_native_password` (Legacy).
12. Define a password for the root user, and also toggle whether MySQL Server should start after the configuration step is complete.
13. Summary is the final step and references a successful and complete MySQL Server installation.
14. MySQL server is now installed. If you chose to not start MySQL, then use either `launchctl` from the command line or start MySQL by clicking "Start" using the MySQL preference pane.

23/07/2024, 08:09 - +234 913 179 8141: please that reminds me to ask


is Power bi Slow normally 

or it depends on the system.

because my system meets the requirements for downloading it yet it take ages to load 

but python and Excel I use work efficiently
23/07/2024, 08:27 - +961 76 913 118: PowerBi is like that sometimes, 
also depending on the system you are using and how large the data you are working with is, 
In my case ,
It just decide to be unfortunate 🙂
23/07/2024, 08:33 - Oluwatomisin DAE: The system capacity in terms of RAM & processor and then the size of the dataset, your data model all contribute to how fast it will work.

It seems Pearson Vue, Microsoft exam scheduling website has Nigeria on the watchlist 

Which means it will now be difficult to schedule exams with your cards 

Dollar cards sometimes might fail you, as mine did 

It make it easier for you and avoid the stress I went through 

Here is your solution ✅✅✅

Good things come to those who deliberately 

take action. 

Those who put in all of the work required to get to their desired goal. 

And most importantly, 

Good things always come to those who take advantage of opportunities that come their way.

All these resume templates doesn't work for me
For instance, if you score 95% in one, try another one

31/07/2024, 16:31 - Iremide: My journey into data analytics was not a solo journey. It wasn't me trying to figure my way through YouTube or Udemy.

My journey is a journey of mentorship and guidance 

I am forever grateful to my mentor, my number 1 cheerleader, the person I run to when I don't seem to understand any concept in data analytics 

The one person who believes in me back then and still believes in me.
I still remember how we close from work to go to lounges to learn data analytics. 

This man sacrificed his time for me to learn, and I grew on his shoulder  of experience and expertise 

Thank you, Mr Aluko @2347031592025

 *I'm new to data analysis and curious to know, what's your favorite tool or software for analyzing data, and why do you prefer it*
06/08/2024, 20:58 - +234 907 815 9834: Having a favorite tool can limit you. 

If I'm not dealing with a lot of data, you will see me using Excel and powerbi.

If it's a large dataset I use R  and SQL.

People use python as well.

I think the problem you want to solve determines the tool you will use. That's all I can say on that.

As a newbie you want to get your hand dirty with Excel I mean the advanced part of excel for analysis like the: power query, power pivot, what if analysis, pivot table and some functions and formulas.

There after you can think of Python or R

In all of this *DAElites* got you covered ✌🏼✌🏼
07/08/2024, 12:55 - +234 816 636 5481: Interesting

I seem to get a little frustrated whenever I use it.

Am looking for a tool that can be an escape route.


currently, I can analyze data with excel and python
07/08/2024, 14:53 - +234 907 815 9834: Tableau is not an escape route for you óò
I'm not good with Looker just used it once so I can't say .

Please give power bi learning time

Traditional clustering methods often fall short when applied to complex spatial datasets, which is why advanced techniques like DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) and HDBSCAN (Hierarchical DBSCAN) are becoming increasingly important.

DBSCAN clusters data points based on density, allowing it to identify clusters of arbitrary shapes and handle outliers effectively. This is crucial in geospatial analysis, where natural features rarely conform to neat geometric shapes. HDBSCAN takes this a step further by accommodating clusters of varying densities, making it ideal for applications where data distribution varies significantly, such as in urban versus rural areas.

These algorithms have broad applications in geospatial data science:
	•	Urban Planning: Identifying zones with similar characteristics for better resource allocation.
	•	Environmental Monitoring: Grouping regions based on environmental conditions to guide conservation efforts.
	•	Disaster Management: Clustering areas with similar risk profiles to prioritize intervention efforts.

Mastering DBSCAN and HDBSCAN enables data analysts to extract deeper insights from geospatial data, leading to more informed decisions and optimized outcomes.

12/08/2024, 09:26 - +234 816 636 5481: People who truly stand out in the world are those who dare to think differently. They do not look at the world and accept it as it is. Instead, they ask, "Why?" and “Why not?”.
 
They are the doubters, the dreamers, the ones who refuse to follow the usual patterns. They carve out their own paths, and these paths often lead to breakthroughs that shape our world.
 
Our minds are not built to fit into a box. They are not passive recipients of life; they are instruments of curiosity. They are built to challenge conventions. The box is a comfort zone, but rarely does anything extraordinary grow from a place of comfort. When you think outside the box, you push the limits of what is possible.
 
Whether it's your career, personal goals, or relationships, there's always room to see things from a different perspective and approach challenges with a fresh mindset.
 
"What are the other ways?"
“Is this the only way?" 
“Does this make sense?”
 
 *The best solutions come from our willingness to challenge the status quo and consider other alternatives*

Rich people don't invest in pleasure
13/08/2024, 20:17 - +234 911 407 2975: No because Someone needs to put his brain to work daily and as the post says one will definitely end up in depression…. And again reinvesting that money and seeing it building a great empire for you will make you more proud. 

So personally I will not take it.
13/08/2024, 20:18 - +234 911 407 2975: It is not always about the money itself but the happiness that comes throughout the journey of making it

13/08/2024, 23:52 - +234 803 749 4691: My question is this, will it be a one off thing? And will the condition stop when the money finishes? Because with the rate of inflation by the I don buy house, car, clothes etc with some dream vacation spots. The money don finish. 

My answer is if that money will be renewed when finished and continue for life, I go collect am but if not when it finishes I go back to square one then, am not interested. <This message was edited>
14/08/2024, 01:26 - +234 706 347 1609: Here are my analysis that I will gladly take the money.

$500M * N 1,500= 750B Naira.

Let’s Assume I want to leave 100 years from now

100years * 365 days = 36,500 days 

Therefore N 750B / 36,500= 20,547,945. 

From the above analysis I will have about 21M daily for 100 years.

I no dey build house for heaven naa🤣🤣🤣

If the person now has a tech skill, that is a big plus because you can earn online and offline
20/08/2024, 20:30 - +234 816 889 2687: CA definitely 😊
20/08/2024, 20:32 - +234 816 889 2687: You could get better opportunities. I’m using my UK experience though
20/08/2024, 20:37 - +1 (437) 221-4207: These are expensive areas. You could get a decent accommodation for as low as $600 including utilities. And if you are willing to share a room with someone, it would even be cheaper like say around $350 to 400. 

It’s just the same way it is in Lagos,Nigeria, you can decide to live at VI or Iyana iworo
20/08/2024, 20:40 - +1 (437) 221-4207: And the good thing is some of these houses are furnished already

20/08/2024, 20:46 - +234 911 407 2975: I’m staying back because moving down to Canada (I just read more about taxes today and what I can say is that, it is very draining) it will be hard to leave comfortable after taxes…..
20/08/2024, 20:47 - +234 911 407 2975: Do you know what you’ll get after taxes
20/08/2024, 20:49 - +234 803 805 9868: Make I go first 😃to know na...

20/08/2024, 20:49 - +234 812 880 0852: Canada all the way, I can always upskill and get a better offer, plus I'll be in a country with a functional system. <This message was edited>
20/08/2024, 20:49 - +234 706 074 8429: Whatever be the tax, the remaining will still be higher than Naija own... Abi tax payment no dey Naija ni
20/08/2024, 20:52 - +1 (437) 221-4207: Exactly 

Especially if you’re skillful in some areas, you offer services to people and they pay you cash. You wouldn’t need to pay tax on cash payments received
20/08/2024, 20:53 - +234 911 407 2975: And inflation is at his peak so the cost of living will be extremely high
20/08/2024, 20:54 - +234 810 944 0526: Thank you
20/08/2024, 20:58 - +234 810 223 1734: I will be staying in Nigeria, unless LMIA could provide me accommodation and some other facilities for at least a year.

Tax is not a joke when it comes to white men countries. 

Out of 12 months that makes a year your 5-6 months salary can be spent on taxes if care is not taken.

20/08/2024, 21:19 - +234 911 407 2975: Not forgetting Metro tickets will also skyrocket if you live far from the city
20/08/2024, 21:29 - +234 807 262 9050: Toronto is practically one of their most expensive cities with the likes of British Columbia

For a start,why would you move to Toronto on a 2000CAD salary?😂💔
20/08/2024, 21:32 - +234 807 262 9050: At least,I get to see my taxes work. I can't say the same for a certain country. I fight for water, electricity, flood, trigger happy policemen and volatile Lagos drivers everyday here 😫🌚

Oh!.....and bad Internet!

21/08/2024, 00:46 - +234 706 749 1957: I will gladly leave Nigeria, not just about the salary involved but about the functionality of the system.
21/08/2024, 00:49 - +234 706 749 1957: As much as u can live comfortably in Nigeria with 1M salary but when it comes to security, ur annual salary can't even save you. God forbid they kidnap you, or you have a minor accident.. People will be busying recording you till you ghost out... so yea, I will rather live a long life in Canada than the uncertainties in this country.
21/08/2024, 05:14 - +961 76 913 118: If the system is working , most people will gladly stay for the 1m salary, I personally will stay in Canada in a Les expensive pronvince, if it’s remote/ hybrid job where I don’t have to go to office everyday and I could get a better opportunity.

21/08/2024, 18:28 - +1 (207) 310-8758: Hello Data elite friends, 

If you’re willing to assist me I would great appreciate it. I need to create a visual showing fuel variation % by period and by region. This report will be for the operations team. They don’t look at data much. How do you think I should execute this so they understand?
21/08/2024, 18:32 - +234 916 123 0445: Awnnn Fola my darling
21/08/2024, 20:36 - +234 708 497 1667: Visual 1: Line Chart for Fuel Variation % by Period:

Create a line chart where the x-axis represents the time periods and the y-axis represents the fuel variation percentage.
Use a single line to show the overall fuel variation across all regions, giving a clear trend over time.

Alternatively, you could use small multiples (mini-charts) for each region if you want to show trends by region but keep them separate.

Visual 2: Bar Chart for Fuel Variation % by Region:

Use a bar chart to show the average or total fuel variation percentage for each region over the entire period.
The x-axis will represent the regions, and the y-axis will represent the fuel variation percentage.
This allows the operations team to quickly compare regions without dealing with time-based fluctuations.

Additional Tips:

Consistent Color Coding: 
Use the same color palette for both visuals to maintain consistency and help the team connect the two charts.

Interactive Elements (Optional): 
If the team is comfortable with basic interactivity, consider adding filters or slicers that allow them to select specific periods or regions to focus on.

- Not networking enough.
 
- Having a short-term mindset and giving up when things don't happen quickly.
 
Want to avoid this?

- Learn a little and test yourself. Solve any issues. Repeat.

- Only learn things that apply to your current situation. There's no point in spending months learning about complex models if you're never going to build one.

- Get sociable (it's never been easier thanks to LinkedIn). Ask questions, help others, and be a good person to talk to. After all, you never know who will see your posts, comments, or profile.

- Think of it as a marathon, not a sprint. I've been working in data for 8 years, and I'm still learning and getting stuck every day.

Enjoy the process. 

A data career really is like no other.

23/08/2024, 14:59 - +234 809 073 9185: If your date column is not in a date format, I doubt if you’d be able to have a date hierarchy 
So change it to date format
23/08/2024, 15:15 - +234 703 035 0803: Load it to power query and change the data type to date. Then you duplicate the column and transform it to your desired choice.
23/08/2024, 15:16 - +234 703 035 0803: After that you can load it back to excel
23/08/2024, 15:23 - +234 908 280 6828: has this been resolved?

23/08/2024, 22:32 - +234 903 665 9676: Could be theoretically true

I mean lots of factors can still be drilled down

I mean over 250million people
36 states

Only Kaduna has 2 million people..... How many "kadunite' can your say earn over 200k.....tbh

Kano has over 40% of its population working as peasant farmers... How many can we really say have a monthly turn over of 200k

Personally (although without facts) I think it could be correct to some extent
23/08/2024, 22:54 - +234 810 083 3669: Yes, my sleep hours shift will be that
23/08/2024, 22:59 - +234 809 073 9185: Are you saying the federal government doesn’t have at least 1m staffs earning above 200k
More so, I hope you know there are well over 5m business men in this Lagos alone

24/08/2024, 07:03 - +234 903 665 9676: How many we be? 

That's false?
24/08/2024, 07:45 - +234 815 169 8588: Another view to it is that this research may be based  on those who have bank accounts and saved an average of 200k in their account.
 There are many people in this country who don't have a bank account
24/08/2024, 08:16 - +234 809 073 9185: Well 5m business men/women in Lagos might be over exaggerated but that figure is wrong 
I’m adding but cooperate staffs and business men too and I’m very very sure that there are well over 10m people earning above 200k in Nigeria

I speak as someone who's worked in a Finance sector with direct access to their net pay. Its heartbreaking to realise that many "civil servants" are paid below minimum wage. I stand corrected, but this is facts.

24/08/2024, 20:08 - +234 911 407 2975: Evening everyone 
Please can you recommend me 5 topics on which I can do a Data Analytics project on.
24/08/2024, 20:15 - +234 708 497 1667: For a detailed Data Analyst Portfolio, you want to cover analytics in at least 3 of these sectors;

📍Sales (Analyse a company's sales, Revenue, profitability etc)
📍Finance (P&L statement, Balance sheet etc)
📍Transportation (Rail, Air, Sea or Road all works)
📍Health (Malaria, Covid, Cancer, Tuberculosis are also good options).
📍Customer Service (A contact centre dashboard or customer complaint management is always a good choice).
📍Banking (Popular choices are loans, fraud and risk management reports)
📍Insurance

These industries have been selected because they are some of the most common industries that employ Data Analyst. 

Having three or more report spread across the industries shows your versatility and willingness to gain domain knowledge needed for a project.

Good luck.

27/08/2024, 20:48 - +234 703 035 0803: 1a) Is there any valid reason for creating a fact and dimension table in Power BI?

1b) If a data analyst doesn't create a fact and dimension table in Power BI does it lead to wrong analysis?
27/08/2024, 20:52 - +234 908 280 6828: Awwwn!!!

I am keeping this comment in my gallery.

#screenshot!!
27/08/2024, 20:57 - Iremide: Hmmmmmmmm!

The whole idea of fact and dimension table is centered around data normalization

There has been 3- 4 theories around how data should be structured and normalised for easy data retrieval and analysis


If all your report is on one flat file, you do not need to bother with fact or dimension tables

Once you are working with 2 files or data tables, you need to think about how each table relate to the other and the best way possible to create a link between the two tables

27/08/2024, 21:22 - +234 807 262 9050: To add to Iremide input,

From an enterprise level perspective, It's easier and cheaper in terms of computing resources to update product record from an independent Product table of 50 rows(dimension table) than a table of 50 million rows containing sales transaction details(fact table).

Normalization also ensures data quality and consistency while eliminating redundancy. <This message was edited>

*Do you think that your location can affect your growth in the tech space, particularly in terms of accessing global opportunities* 

Is this true *Data Elites* ? 🤔
03/09/2024, 20:34 - Iremide: Yes

There are some jobs I tried applying for. I would see sorry we do not accept application from your location 

Except I wan use incognito mood hide my location but it's not worth the stress coz they will find out later
03/09/2024, 20:36 - +234 816 636 5481: Interesting 🤔
03/09/2024, 20:39 - +234 916 162 8756: Location is a challenge, especially in Nigeria. A lot of the "unfortunately" are as a result of location. people with only Excel experience earn good in Europe but because of location, the probability of getting unfortunately in a data entry job is high.
03/09/2024, 22:01 - +234 810 498 0080: Definitely location affects a lot, for example when HR filter out applications, location is usually one of the first criteria in weeding out applicants, unless its explicitly stated that its remote job.
04/09/2024, 10:10 - +234 816 636 5481: Location is very important
04/09/2024, 10:18 - +234 818 156 1466: Even when is remote, location does
04/09/2024, 10:39 - +234 816 636 5481: How are y'all doing today?


I feel like the Month is running

Who else thinks so? <This message was edited>
04/09/2024, 10:44 - +234 703 035 0803: The truth is, when you're good in whatever skill you have, location doesn't matter. Rules and processes can be broken or suspended just to hire you.
04/09/2024, 10:46 - +234 816 636 5481: lol, you mean the supernatural happens🤣😂

This guyyyy😅
04/09/2024, 10:54 - +234 703 035 0803: Not really
04/09/2024, 11:01 - +234 702 555 7148: See joke.

Isn't it only until you're given a chance to showcase your ability that they will know you're good at it?

When we're talking about location being a constraint.
You won't be able to access some resources self talkless being able to prove to them that you're good
04/09/2024, 11:07 - +234 702 555 7148: A good example is when FG ban Nigerians from using Twitter(X).
No Nigerian was able to use the platform unless the person changed their IP address using a VPN.

Assuming that there is no option to change your IP address or there is nothing like a VPN.

No matter how good you are, you might not be able to access any opportunity posted on that platform. <This message was edited>
04/09/2024, 11:10 - +234 810 498 0080: Apparently, some remote jobs would only hire applicants from a particular region
04/09/2024, 11:11 - +234 703 035 0803: Once you're good in your field, recruiters and hiring managers will need your services even when you're not in the preferred location
04/09/2024, 11:11 - +234 706 294 3369: I don't think it is the same thing
04/09/2024, 11:13 - +234 810 498 0080: I like the point you're coming from, cause some companies/firm offer relocation package when they can attest to the value you'd contribute to their business 

But what @2347025557148 is trying to state is that even though you have the required skills and you're quite good, your location will play a major role on the opportunities that will be available for you.
04/09/2024, 11:14 - +234 703 035 0803: Haven't you heard testimonies of people saying that they received an email or a phone call from a hiring manager in a company and location they didn't apply for seeking for his/her services? <This message was edited>
04/09/2024, 11:15 - +234 706 294 3369: It depends on the company, some are flexible as you mentioned
04/09/2024, 11:15 - +234 702 555 7148: Thanks for the simplification 🤗.
04/09/2024, 11:27 - +234 810 498 0080: Definitely
04/09/2024, 11:29 - +234 810 498 0080: Most of these are from recommendations tbh, or people with good profiles on platforms like LinkedIn, X.. wherr recruiters often look for eligible candidates.
04/09/2024, 11:29 - +234 810 498 0080: You're welcome
04/09/2024, 11:30 - +234 702 555 7148: I guess you've moved away completely from the base discussion.

Because you might not even have access to the opportunity in the first place.
Or got filtered out automatically by the validation rule base on location that was put in place for application review.


In a  case where by people got a call or an email from a hiring manager without applying. 

It's most likely to be referral or the  hiring manager was impressed by the skills you showcase somewhere sha.

In nutshell, they will have  heard of you, or see your ability before insisting that you're the one they prefer
04/09/2024, 11:36 - +234 703 035 0803: Just dey good first. Na them go they rush you.
04/09/2024, 11:38 - +234 702 555 7148: I'm with you bro 😎

04/09/2024, 11:41 - +234 703 035 0803: Do these 3 things first:
1. Network 
2. Have a good portfolio 
3. Keep good relationships

Step 2: Learn "Enough" Do not get into a course rut. Take one fundamental course on Excel, SQL, and a BI tool

Step 3: Do "Enough" Don't build 20 projects. Don't create some complicated project. Do 3-5 projects and make those look clean

Step 4: Don't overcomplicate projects
Keep things simple. Answer 1-2 business questions and call it a day

Step 5: Prioritize
 Focus on what really matters. And that's finding people who are hiring (use LinkedIn like a search engine and type "hiring data analyst.

*I am planning to learn Data analytics. I have a non-IT background. How shall I go about it?*

Elites, I need your opinion on this
10/09/2024, 16:00 - +234 815 262 5712: my answer: If you aree you ready to put in the work... there are numerous resources, but you need to read and practice
10/09/2024, 16:22 - +234 703 035 0803: You don't need to have an IT background before you can become a data analyst. All you need is determination and  perseverance. You also need to read and practice just like what @2348152625712 said. Above all you need a community where you can meet other data analysts and collaborate on a project.

10/09/2024, 18:22 - Accommo Taoheed: 16
10/09/2024, 18:23 - +234 809 543 1955: 8÷2(2+2) =?
8÷2(4) =?
8÷8 =1
Therefore 8÷2(2+2) = 1
10/09/2024, 18:23 - +234 816 812 9851: Hmm why?
10/09/2024, 18:24 - Accommo Taoheed: First do bracket (2+2) which is 4
Then 8 divided by 2 = 4, then 4*4= 16 <This message was edited>
10/09/2024, 18:24 - +234 816 812 9851: I can see PEDMAS and BODMAS approach

10/09/2024, 18:28 - Accommo Taoheed: If you use calculator, you will also get 16

I need a favor... I'm having a preliminary test with a company soon as a graduate trainee... Please any idea about where questions could come from so as to prepare well
10/09/2024, 20:22 - +234 816 636 5481: Let's do well to help out 🙏
10/09/2024, 20:23 - +234 816 636 5481: <Media omitted>
10/09/2024, 20:30 - +234 816 636 5481: On today's episode of *Tuesday Spill it* 

 *When handling missing data, what informs your decision to either keep the column or to delete the column or even to impute the column using statistical methods?*

 *What is your thought process whenever you encounter missing values?*
10/09/2024, 20:37 - +234 812 880 0852: When dealing with missing data, I think about how important the data is to what I'm trying to figure out. If it's really important, I'll try to fill in the gaps. If it's not that important, I might just delete it. I also think about how much data is missing if it's a lot, I'll try to fill it.
10/09/2024, 20:44 - +234 812 387 6885: I'll say it depends on the data you are working with and also the importance of the data. Study your data critically, and you'll be able to figure out the best way to handle missing values in that particular dataset.
Further more, in some dataset, if you delete the columns or rows that have missing values, you might end up deleting vital information.. that's why you need to study the dataset..
You can even leave the missing values like that, if it isn't so important to you.
10/09/2024, 20:45 - +234 816 636 5481: I used Bodmas and got 16 🥲
10/09/2024, 20:52 - +234 816 636 5481: Okay Elites, I am waiting for others

Don't read and pass oo 👀
10/09/2024, 20:55 - +234 816 636 5481: What is the full meaning of PEDMAS?
10/09/2024, 20:58 - +234 816 812 9851: It's actually PEMDAS
10/09/2024, 20:59 - +234 816 812 9851: PEMDAS I meant 
P- parenthesis ()
E- Expression 
M- Multiplication 
D- Division
A- Addition 
S- subtraction 
 This is an order in python it works same for BODMAS in mathematics
10/09/2024, 20:59 - +234 816 636 5481: Oh, PEMDAD I see
10/09/2024, 21:01 - +234 816 636 5481: Cool
10/09/2024, 21:03 - +234 915 432 9970: and SQL too
10/09/2024, 21:03 - +234 816 636 5481: @2348168129851
10/09/2024, 21:05 - +234 816 812 9851: Measures of central tendency comes to my mind after reading the story behind the data for a right direction
A whole lot of questioning
That's why I often say we shouldn't be shy asking questions as data professionals it's part of the job and it's for clarity too <This message was edited>
10/09/2024, 21:52 - +234 703 035 0803: Before you start removing, keeping or imputing any values you must. 

1. Have a duplicate copy of the data

2. Study the dataset. Not every dataset you impute 0 or use any statistical method if the value is missing. Just imagine you're working on a healthcare dataset and you imput 0 or any value in the column that contains patients BP or sugar level.

3. Call your client, supervisor, HOD, stakeholders and inform them about the missing data. Anything they tell you to do, do it and ensure you have documented any advice given to you. Or tell them to send it through mail. 

You can't take decisions on missing values alone. Unless you're working on a dataset from Kaggle. <This message was edited>
10/09/2024, 22:01 - +234 816 636 5481: I know a wise man 😜
10/09/2024, 22:39 - +234 810 718 0669: 1
10/09/2024, 22:45 - +234 810 718 0669: Thank you
11/09/2024, 09:08 - +234 816 239 5465: If the missing data in a dataset exceeds 50%, I remove those entries. Otherwise, I fill the missing values with the mean of the available data.
11/09/2024, 09:15 - +961 76 913 118: If you are working with financial , customers or sales data , You don’t want to do that , just replace missing values with 0 or N/A depending on the data type
And all if you are misssing 50%of your data, contact your Stakeholders ASAP <This message was edited>
11/09/2024, 09:16 - +234 806 353 2179: 8/2(2+2)

11/09/2024, 10:14 - +234 906 501 1762: What I'll say inform my decision is to look at the dataset and identify my dim and my fact columns. If the columns that have missing values are fact then I'll definitely find a way to fill it up but if it's in dim table and it's not really asking a reasonable question I remove it.
11/09/2024, 10:41 - +961 76 913 118: If you are talking about data Modeling , You should know what you are working with,Your main table should contain all of your data , and also should be cleaned before modeling it, replace your missing value before creating your Fact table , which contains mostly your quantitative data , the Primary keys shouldn’t contain Null ,and Dim Tables, which are mostly qualitative data , the primary keys shouldn’t have duplicate.
11/09/2024, 10:52 - +234 816 636 5481: null
11/09/2024, 10:54 - +234 906 501 1762: Not talking about modelling yet actually
11/09/2024, 10:55 - +234 906 501 1762: Some databases are always in dim and fact with no main table or so
11/09/2024, 10:56 - +961 76 913 118: 👍

17/09/2024, 22:40 - +234 816 812 9851: Best practices for writing SQL 📊queries: 

1- Write SQL keywords in capital letters. 

2- Use table aliases with columns when you are joining multiple tables. 

3- Never use select *, always mention list of columns in select clause. 

4- Add useful comments wherever you write complex logic. Avoid too many comments. 

5- Use joins instead of subqueries when possible for better performance. 

6- Create CTEs instead of multiple sub queries , it will make your query easy to read. 

7- Join tables using JOIN keywords instead of writing join condition in where clause for better readability. 

8- Never use order by in sub queries , It will unnecessary increase runtime. 

9- If you know there are no duplicates in 2 tables, use UNION ALL instead of UNION for better performance.

21/09/2024, 19:10 - +234 906 690 9017: Square both sides to remove the square root which will give : x + 5 = 8 race to power 2
 Then 8 race to power 2 will give 64
x+5=64

Then Subtract 5 from both sides:
x
=
64 - 5
x=64−5
x = 59

Final answer:
X=59
